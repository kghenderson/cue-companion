this package illustrates a nice interactive example for buying ice cream.

there's a story to go along with it (to be copied later),<br/>
but essentially,<br/>
there are certain ice creams which are allowed at home,<br/>         
there is a preference order for which ice creams are preferred,<br/>
finally, there's what's available at the market

the remaining objects are performing the computation to check
what's available & allowed, and select the top available preference.
